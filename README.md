# Overview

## Interview Buddy

A peer-to-peer platform for practicing interviews for DS&A, Behavioral, System Design, Frontend, Practice with a Friend, and more. This is a powerful tool for job seekers and anyone who is preparing for interviews.

 Such a platform can facilitate the exchange of technical knowledge and provide valuable feedback to improve interview skills.

Here's how the application could work:

Registration: The user would register on the platform and create a profile with their technical skills and areas of interest.

Matching: The platform would match users with other users who have similar technical skills and interests.

Scheduling: Once matched, users could schedule a time to conduct a mock interview.

Practice interview: During the mock interview, users could take turns being the interviewer and interviewee. The interviewer would ask technical questions related to the interviewee's area of expertise, and the interviewee would have a set amount of time to answer the questions.

Feedback: After the practice interview, both users could provide feedback to each other, highlighting areas of strength and areas that need improvement.

Progress tracking: The platform could also track the user's progress over time, indicating areas where the user has improved and areas that still need work.

Overall, such an application could provide a valuable resource for job seekers looking to improve their technical interview skills. By practicing with peers, users can gain confidence and improve their ability to communicate technical knowledge effectively.


Community Support: The application could also provide a community of support and encouragement for users. This could include forums for discussion, expert advice, and motivational content.

Overall, an Interview Buddy application could be a valuable resource for job seekers who are looking to improve their interview skills and gain confidence. By providing a supportive and personalized approach to interview preparation, the application could help users achieve their goals and land their dream jobs.

## Challenges I ran into
We struggled, learned, and enjoy working with the Hurdle SDK. The SDK has great methods that made easy the integration and the end product came up really nicely together, we loved it.


Huddle
